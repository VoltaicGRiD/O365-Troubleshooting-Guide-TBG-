Tek O365 troubleshooting database &amp; queue management software

## DEPRECATED
This project was discontinued a long time ago and no longer utilized. On top of that, at the time, my file and project data structure was awful.

## Introduction
A simple program designed to assist Microsoft Support Engineers with queue and case management as well as a quick reference guide for common troubleshooting tasks and common issues. Discontinued due to lack of scalability and response on internal team management.
